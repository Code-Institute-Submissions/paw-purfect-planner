## Demo
A live demo of the website can be found [here](https://paw-purfect-planner.herokuapp.com/).

## Project-purpose
To build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, and MongoDB.

## UX
#### The ideal Paw Purfect User is:
- Reading and Speaking English
- A pet owner or a pet sitter
- Busy, so keeping all their pet information in one place and easy to access is important.

#### Stradegy
The stradegy of the design was to give the user a clean and easy way to access their pets information all from one user profile.

#### Scope
The vistors of this site will get quick acces to an overview of there pets important information. They will be able to schedule important upcoming appointments. Also giving them a view into their pets history.

#### Structure
Most pet record sites leave the pet owner bogged down with features that are hard to find. I am starting the build on the site to be simple with nested functions that are intuativly placed. The future builds will be based on this original design.
